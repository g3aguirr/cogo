## Project Ideas

- **Word of the Day**:
The purpose of this app would be to help those trying to learn a spoken language by providing a daily word to learn of a particular language such as Spanish, Chinese, or Japanese. Generally words displayed would be those most common in each language for practical use. Some features would include word suggestions, word quizzes of the week, and maybe ever practice drawing the characters. 

- **Where to Live** 
The purpose of this app would be to help users search for a place to live. It would allow users to rank preferences and calculate what would be the best place for a user based on their input and the availability. We would also be able display charts and graphs so that the user can easily compare one living space to another.

- **Help Anxiety**
This app would help its users check on their mental health through assessments and give advice on how to improve their status. The user would for example rank their stress level on a scale and the app would provide suggestions. The info would be recorded and tracked to showcase improvement or warn of worsening of mental status through charts and graphs.

- **Chat Analyzer**
This app would analyze files of chat logs and display the results in form of graphs and charts. It would be able to note the most active messengers, most used words per users, order users joined the chat group, time it takes for users to respond etc. This app would be able help moderators. For example, it can be used to gather evidence to ban a toxic user within a chat group.
